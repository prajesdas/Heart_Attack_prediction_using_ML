# ❤️‍🔥 Heart Attack Prediction Using Machine Learning 🩺  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a **Machine Learning (ML) model** 🧠 to predict the **risk of heart attacks** 💔 based on **medical and lifestyle factors**. By analyzing patient data, the system provides **early warnings** 🚨 and helps in **preventive healthcare** 🏥.  

## 🚀 Features  
- 📊 **Predicts Heart Attack Risk** – Uses ML algorithms to analyze health parameters.  
- 🧠 **Feature Engineering** – Considers key factors like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and lifestyle habits.  
- 🔍 **Data-Driven Insights** – Identifies patterns in patient health data.  
- ⚙️ **Multiple ML Models** – Compares different algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.) for better accuracy.  
- 📈 **Visualizations & Reports** – Provides graphs and insights for easy interpretation.
